This is a way of drawing Sierpinski Triangle using Python's lists. 

According to wikipedia: "The Sierpiński triangle, also called the Sierpiński gasket or Sierpiński sieve, is a fractal attractive fixed set with the overall shape of an equilateral triangle, subdivided recursively into smaller equilateral triangles."

I created a technique using list and cell expansions to generate a triangle using strings and lists, please give creit when using this method.
